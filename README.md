# Loraswitch
Adds quick switching of LORA to oobabooga TEXT WEB UI
- first you need to add multiple loras in Model tab.
- then you can quickly switch between them
- works only in gptq-for-llama (peft) not in AutoGPTQ

Currently in the main branch of ooba there need to be fix in LORA code otherwise it will display the first loaded lora as 'default', 
I submitted pull request to fix it.
